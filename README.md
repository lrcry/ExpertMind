## Deployment

You may deploy this application using either Docker or manual methods, but using Docker is recommended, because you don't need to worry about the installation of Python and its dependencies, it will run in a sandbox environment, and it can be easily removed.

### Deploy with Docker (Recommended)

1. Install Docker in the machine for deployment.

   See Docker installation documentation for [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/started/), [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/mac/started), or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/started).

2. Run `sudo docker build -t expert-mind .` in the source root folder. (donâ€™t forget the `.` period)

   You may run `sudo docker images` to check if the image has been built successfully.

3. Run `sudo docker run -d -p "80:8000" expert-mind` to start the server.

   Here we map the `80` port in the host machine to the `8000` port in the Docker container. In your real environment, you may need to change `80` to an available port.

   You may run `sudo docker ps` to check if the server is running.

4. Open `http://localhost` in your browser. If you are using other ports rather than `80`, you should append it to the end of this url.

5. If you want to stop it, firstly get the container id using `sudo docker ps`, and then run `sudo docker stop CONTAINER_ID` to stop it.

6. If you want to remove the image, run `sudo docker rmi -f expert-mind`.


### Manual Deployment
