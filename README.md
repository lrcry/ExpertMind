## Deployment

### Deploy with Docker (recommended)

1. Install Docker in the machine for deployment.

   See Docker installation documentation for [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/started/), [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/mac/started), or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/started).

2. Run `sudo docker build -t expert-mind .` in the source root folder. (donâ€™t forget the `.` period)

   You may run `sudo docker images` to check if the image has been built successfully.

3. Run `sudo docker run -d -p "80:8000" expert-mind` to start the server.

   Here we map the `80` port in the host machine to the `8000` port in the Docker container. In your real environment, you may need to change `80` to an available port.

   You may run `sudo docker ps` to check if the server is running.

4. Open `http://localhost` in your browser.

5. If you want to stop it, firstly get the container id using `sudo docker ps`, and then run `sudo docker stop CONTAINER_ID` to stop it.

6. If you want to remove the image, run `sudo docker rmi expert-mind`.


### Manual Deployment

Before deploy and use ExpertMind REST Service codes on your computer, please make sure that you have Python 2.7 and PIP installed. Use [SetupTools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) to setup and manage package index of python is highly recommended here.

  - Use PIP to install Django framework
      ```shell
      pip install Django
      ```
      See [Django installation documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/install/#installing-official-release).
  - Use PIP to install Django REST framework support  
      ```shell
      pip install djangorestframework
      pip install markdown
      pip install django-filter
      ```
      See [Django REST frameworkd installation documentation](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/#installation)


  - Use PIP to install orchestrate mongodb service support  
      ```shell
      pip install porc
      ```
  - Startup
      - Go into the root folder of *the service* in a Terminal or &#42;nix shell environment
      - In the Terminal or &#42;nix shell environment, type the following command:
          ```shell
          python manage.py runserver
          ```
      - In a browser, type *http://localhost:8000/* to test if the services have been started up successfully.

## API Specification

  - Node operation
    - Create a new node by the following

      *POST /api/create_new_node/*

      with the JSON body like
      ```json
      {
        "nodeDisplay": "This is a test Node name",
        "nodeDescription": "This is a test Node description",
        "userId": "user_test_id" // if someone do this without logged in, just leave it blank
      }
      ```
    - Add a child node to an existed node  

      *POST /api/add_child_node/*

      with the JSON body like
      ```json
      {
        "nodeDisplay": "this is a test child node name",
        "nodeDescription": "this is a test child node description",
        "nodeParents"0: [
          {"_id": "someParentId"}
        ],
        "userId": "user_test_id" // if someone do this without logged in, just leave it blank
      }
      ```
      *Note: in current version of the services, only one parent for each node will be taken into consideration. That means if you pass a JSON body with multiple nodeParents, the services will take the first parent as the parent of the child node to be added.*

    - Get information of a Node by its ID

      *GET /api/nodes/[node_id]*

      If a node is successfully retrieved, the response will generally be
      ```json
      {
        "result": "success",
        "data":
        {
          "nodeDisplay": "name",
          "nodeDescription": "description",
          "nodeTags": [
            { "_id": "someId" },
            { "_id": "otherId" }
          ],
          "nodeParents": [
            { "_id": "aParent" }
          ],
          "nodeChildren": [
            { "_id": "child1" },
            { "_id": "child2" }
          ],
          "nodeVotes": [
            { "_id": "goodVote3329" },
            { "_id": "badVote10641" }
          ],
          "nodeStatus": "1",
          "nodeCreateAt": "2015-09-29 13:42:51"
        }
      }
      ```

    - Get information of descendant nodes of a Node by its ID  

      *GET /api/nodes/[node_id]/descendant/*

      If a node is successfully retrieved, the response will generally be

      ```json
      {
        "result": "success",
        "data":
        {
          "nodeDisplay": "name",
          "nodeDescription": "description",
          "nodeTags": [
            { "_id": "someId" },
            { "_id": "otherId" }
          ],
          "nodeParents": [
            { "_id": "aParent" }
          ],
          "nodeChildren": [
            { "_id": "child1" },
            { "_id": "child2" }
          ],
          "nodeVotes": [
            { "_id": "goodVote3329" },
            { "_id": "badVote10641" }
          ],
          "nodeStatus": "1",
          "nodeCreateAt": "2015-09-29 13:42:51"
        }
      }
      ```
      *Note: in this case the response will contain a list of descendant node information.*

    - Get information of children nodes of a Node by its ID

      *GET /api/nodes/[node_id]/children/*

      ```json
      {
        "result": "success",
        "data":
        {
          "nodeDisplay": "name",
